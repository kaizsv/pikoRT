Piko/RT Design & Concept
========================

Piko/RT is a tiny Linux-like real-time opreating system kenrel, optimized for
ARM Cortex-M series microprocessors.

Being compatible with Linux is **NOT** the goal of Piko/RT. Instead, PSE51
(minimal real-time system profile) should be appropriately an analog from
the perspective of design.
